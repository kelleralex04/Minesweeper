# MINESWEEPER

In 1990 Microsoft released Microsoft Minesweeper as part of their Windows Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.11. Since then, Minesweeper has been a staple of default Windows games and has spawned a wide range of variants and knockoffs. Click a square to explore while trying to avoid mines. Use the numbers to navigate your way through the dangerous minefield. Be careful; one wrong click and it's game over!

To get started, just click! Left click on a square to explore that space.

If you know where a mine is located, you can right click on that square to flag it, making it unclickable.

To restart, click Smiley at the top of the board. He will show you how you're doing in the game.

Uncover each space without clicking on a mine and Smiley will throw on some shades to show his relief.
